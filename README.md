# Web App Feedback Repository

This repository serves as a centralized location where I will document my feedback for the [notibly.app](https://notibly.app/) alpha release. This repo will track suggestions, issues, and general thoughts about the app’s development.

## Index:

* **Feature Requests**:
    * [27-10-24-documents](./feature-requests/) - see: open source feature request services & additional notes
	* [05-09-24.md](./feature-requests/05-09-24.md)
	* [20-09-24.md](./feature-requests/20-09-24.md)

*Note: No other feedback at this time...*

## How to Use This Repository

- **Developer's Access**: You can watch this repository to receive notifications whenever new feedback is added or changes are made. This way, you'll be updated in real-time.
- **Updates**: I will notify you by email if significant changes or updates are pushed to the repo, but feel free to check in at any time.

**I will include an index at the top of the README.md to quickly find any feedback. Filenames are simply dates in the format: DD-MM-YY.md. You will find the files categoriesed within their appropriate folder, see below).**

## Feedback Structure

*Note: This method of feedback structure is not yet fully formally adopted, but it's pretty there, moving fowards this is how feedback will be categoriesed.*

Each piece of feedback is categorized for easier tracking. Below are the sections and types of feedback you'll find:

### 1. **Bugs**
   - Documented bugs encountered during usage, including steps to reproduce and any other details to assist in debugging.

### 2. **Feature Requests**
   - Suggestions for new features or enhancements to existing functionality.

### 3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Feedback related to design, usability, and user experience.

### 4. **Performance Issues**
   - Notes on performance, loading times, and general responsiveness of the web app.

### 5. **General Thoughts**
   - Additional observations that don’t fit into the above categories.

## How Feedback is Organized

- Feedback will be placed in individual markdown files within the respective folder (e.g., `bugs`, `feature-requests`, `ui-ux`, `performance`).
- Each entry will have a **title**, **description**, and, if applicable, **suggested solutions**.

## How to Track Feedback

You can check for new feedback by watching the repo or by viewing the commit history. Feedback will be committed with clear messages indicating what was added or updated (e.g., "Added bug report for login issue" or "Suggested feature for enhanced dashboard").

### Authors Note:

I appriciate being able to participate in the alpha release of Notibly.app, I stumbled across it at, pretty much, the exact time I needed something like this. I've been out of university for a number of years; and I wasn't aware of other similar tools; so I've adopted using this pretty much for most of my note-taking needs. As such, I am also invested in seeing the app grow and improve, as I hope it aids in my own journey through my MSc.
